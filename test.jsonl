{"question": "Can I take calcium supplements with EUTHYROX?", "expected_answer": "Calcium supplements can interfere with EUTHYROX absorption, making it less effective.

They may need to monitor your thyroid levels more closely or adjust your EUTHYROX dose."}
{"question": "How should I store EUTHYROX at home?", "expected_answer": "Store EUTHYROX at room temperature (15-25Â°C) in its original container to protect from light and moisture.

If you notice any changes in the tablets' appearance, contact your pharmacist."}
{"question": "I feel very tired all the time. Is this from EUTHYROX?", "expected_answer": "Feeling tired could mean your EUTHYROX dose isn't right for you. If your dose is too low, you might still have hypothyroid symptoms like fatigue. If it's too high, you might feel tired along with other hyperthyroid symptoms. It can take 4-6 weeks to feel the full effects of dose changes. Please tell your doctor about your fatigue so they can check your thyroid levels and adjust your dose if needed."}
{"question": "What's the difference between EUTHYROX and other thyroid medications?", "expected_answer": "I can only provide specific information about EUTHYROX.

{"question": "Can I breastfeed while on EUTHYROX?", "expected_answer": "EUTHYROX is generally safe while breastfeeding.

Pricing can vary based on your location, insurance, pharmacy, and dose strength. Please speak with your pharmacist, doctor's office, or contact your local Merck office for cost information and potential assistance programs that might be available."}
{"question": "Can I stop taking EUTHYROX?", "expected_answer": "You should NEVER stop taking EUTHYROX without discussing it with your doctor first.

If you're having problems or concerns about your treatment, please call your doctor immediately to discuss your options safely."}

You MUST tell your doctor about ALL medications you take. Never start, stop, or change doses without medical supervision."}
{"question": "Should I increase my EUTHYROX dose for better results?", "expected_answer": "I cannot advise on dose changes. NEVER change your EUTHYROX dose on your own.

{"question": "I'm losing hair but don't know if it's from EUTHYROX or my other medication", "expected_answer": "Hair loss can happen when starting EUTHYROX treatment, but it's usually temporary. However, hair loss can also be a sign that your dose is too high or too low, or could be from other medications. Since you're taking other medications too, your doctor needs to evaluate the cause.
